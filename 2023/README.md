# 2023 Project

This project is a simple Go application that demonstrates how to set up a web server and handle requests using a modular structure.

## Project Structure

```
2023
├── src
│   ├── main.go          # Entry point of the application
│   └── handlers
│       └── handler.go   # Contains request handling logic
├── go.mod               # Module dependencies
├── go.sum               # Dependency checksums
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

To run this application, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 2023
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```
   go run src/main.go
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can send requests to the defined routes. The application will process these requests using the handlers defined in the `handlers` package.
